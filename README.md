### [Summary of Homework 1](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS327-CyberSecurity-CryptoGraphy/tree/Homeworks/HW01)

#### Summary of the Assignment:
The assignment is to perform threat modeling for a system where a 'Host Web Client' interacts with:

A 'Remote Web Server' via an HTTP request/response cycle.
An external 'User' via a generic command/service cycle.
A 'File System' using a read/write cycle.
The task requires creating a data flow diagram (DFD) and identifying threats using the STRIDE approach (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege). While proposing mitigations for the identified threats is optional, the main objective is to perform threat modeling from the perspective of a system administrator for the company controlling the 'Host Web Client'. The threat model should focus on a company perspective rather than an end-user perspective.
