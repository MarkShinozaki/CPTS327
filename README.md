### [Summary of Homework 1](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS327-CyberSecurity-CryptoGraphy/tree/Homeworks/HW01)

#### Summary of the Assignment:
The assignment is to perform threat modeling for a system where a 'Host Web Client' interacts with:

A 'Remote Web Server' via an HTTP request/response cycle.
An external 'User' via a generic command/service cycle.
A 'File System' using a read/write cycle.
The task requires creating a data flow diagram (DFD) and identifying threats using the STRIDE approach (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege). While proposing mitigations for the identified threats is optional, the main objective is to perform threat modeling from the perspective of a system administrator for the company controlling the 'Host Web Client'. The threat model should focus on a company perspective rather than an end-user perspective.

Deliverable:
A report documenting the specifications listed in the assignment. The report should be restricted to two pages, excluding the DFD and the attack tree.

Grading Rubric:
Logical Reasoning (30%): Making sound and logical arguments.
Readability (30%): Precision, conciseness, and using fonts that are readable.
Content (40%): Including all required sections as specified.
Topics Learned:
Threat Modeling: Building a data flow diagram, identifying threats using the STRIDE approach, and considering different types of threat actors such as external attackers and insiders.
Security Principles: Understanding of Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege, and the potential impact of these threats on system security.
Mitigation Techniques: Best practices for mitigating threats, such as strong authentication, data encryption, traffic monitoring, and enforcing access controls.
