### Instructor Interaction
I want you to succeed. Please use the discussion forum for all questions related to the coursework. I usually reply to forum posts within 24 hours. The forum can be found under the 'Discussions' page for questions regarding the course material.

Please limit emailing me to situations that involve FERPA-protected information (grades, private affairs, etc.). Everything else can be discussed in the forum. Same-day appointments via email may be available for emergencies.

### Attendance
Attendance is **required** for all class lectures. No grade points will be allocated for attendance. No tracking of attendance will be performed.

### Late Work Policy
Assignments are due by the established due dates and times stated in the course schedule on Canvas. It is better to turn in something instead of nothing. If an emergency occurs, the instructor will accommodate the student as much as possible.

- 0-24 hours late: 80% of the final score
- 24-48 hours late: 50% of the final score
- Beyond 48 hours: 0%

Make-up exams will not be possible unless the student speaks with the instructor at least two days in advance. Emergencies do occur, and rescheduling of exams because of these is to be determined by the instructor.

### Incomplete Grade Policy (Academic Rule 90h)
Incompletes are granted only with permission of the instructor and are subject to the following guidelines:

1. Students must request an incomplete in writing or by email from the instructor before the end of the semester.
2. The request must be signed and dated by the student (or identified by the student's email address) and must explain the reasons behind the request for the incomplete.
3. In order to be considered for an incomplete, there are two main conditions:
    - A student must complete a minimum of 75 percent of the assigned coursework.
    - A student must have a mathematical possibility of scoring a 60 percent or above for the entire course.
4. If extraordinary circumstances (e.g., family emergency, serious illness) are involved and are documented to the instructor's satisfaction, the professor/instructor retains the discretion to grant an incomplete even if the minimum conditions outlined in item 3 above are not met.

If an incomplete is granted, the standard WSU policy applies (i.e., **ALL** work must be completed within one full year from the end of the enrollment semester at issue, unless a shorter time is specified by the instructor. Otherwise, an automatic grade of "F," or failing, will be entered on the student’s transcript).
